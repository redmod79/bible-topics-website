These are not separate conclusions -- they are what the verses say.</li> <li>Context determines meaning. Analyze words and phrases using expanding circles: verse &gt; paragraph &gt; chapter &gt; book &gt; same author &gt; whole Bible. Context must match before assuming the same meaning across passages.</li> <li>Scripture is the only authority for doctrine. Church fathers, ancient Jewish sources, and denominational traditions are not authoritative. The question is always: \"What does the Bible say?\"</li> <li>The counter-claim to an explicit statement is often the real inference.

The number 14 is the numerical value (gematria) of the name David in Hebrew (dalet=4 + vav=6 + dalet=4 = 14). By structuring the genealogy in three groups of 14, Matthew embeds David's name into the very structure of the record.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deliberate selectivity.

Comparing Matthew 1:8 (\"Joram begat Ozias\") with 1 Chronicles 3:11-12 reveals that three kings are omitted between Joram and Uzziah (Ozias): Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah. This demonstrates that Matthew is not attempting an exhaustive biological record but constructing a theological genealogy.

The most consistent pattern across all the evidence is the distinction between legal and biological lines of descent. Matthew presents the legal kingly succession (through Joseph, through Solomon, through the kings of Judah). Luke presents what appears to be the biological descent (through Mary, through Nathan, avoiding the royal line). The word studies confirm this: gennao shifts from active to passive at the exact point where the legal-biological distinction must be made (Matthew 1:16); nomizo in Luke 3:23 (\"as was supposed\") qualifies the Joseph connection as public reckoning rather than biological fact.</p> </li> <li> <p>Complementary, not contradictory, design. Every point of difference between the genealogies serves a theological purpose. Matthew traces forward (Abraham to Jesus) for a Jewish audience focused on covenant history. Luke traces backward (Jesus to Adam to God) for a Gentile audience focused on universal humanity. Matthew traces through Solomon for legal throne succession. Luke traces through Nathan for biological descent free from the Jeconiah curse. Matthew begins with the Messianic titles \"Son of David, Son of Abraham.\" Luke ends with \"son of God.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>The virgin birth as the integrating mechanism. The virgin birth is not merely a doctrinal claim supported by the genealogies -- it is the mechanism that makes the two genealogies work together. Without the virgin birth, Jesus would be biologically descended from Jeconiah (through Joseph) and the throne claim would be cursed. Without the legal connection through Joseph, Jesus would have no throne to claim. The voice shift in Matthew 1:16 and the qualifier in Luke 3:23 both encode the virgin birth into the genealogical records themselves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Progressive narrowing and specificity of prophecy. The OT prophecies progressively narrow the Messianic line: from all humanity (Genesis 3:15, \"seed of the woman\") to Abraham's seed (Genesis 22:18) to Judah's tribe (Genesis 49:10) to David's line (2 Samuel 7:12-16) to a virgin birth (Isaiah 7:14) to Bethlehem (Micah 5:2). Both genealogies track through every stage of this narrowing funnel.</p> </li> <li> <p>The four women prepare for Mary. Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba in Matthew's genealogy prepare the reader for the most extraordinary irregularity of all -- Mary's virgin conception. Each prior woman involved circumstances that appeared scandalous but through which God preserved the Messianic line. Each involved a Gentile element, foreshadowing the gospel's universal scope. Mary stands as the climax of this pattern.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"studies/genealogies-of-jesus/03-analysis/#what-the-word-studies-reveal","title":"What the Word Studies Reveal","text":"<ul> <li>gennao (G1080): The 39 active uses followed by 1 passive use in Matthew 1 constitute a deliberate grammatical marker distinguishing Jesus' birth from all preceding generations.

Matthew, writing to a Jewish audience, presents a descending genealogy from Abraham through David through Solomon through the kings of Judah to Joseph, establishing Jesus' legal right to the throne of David as the promised Messianic King. Luke, writing to Theophilus (a Gentile), presents an ascending genealogy from Jesus backward through David's son Nathan all the way to Adam and to God, establishing Jesus' biological descent from David and his connection to all humanity as Savior of the world.</p> <p>The differences between the two genealogies -- Joseph's father (Jacob in Matthew, Heli in Luke), the line from David (Solomon in Matthew, Nathan in Luke), the direction and scope -- are not errors but intentional features that together resolve what would otherwise be an impossible theological problem. The Jeconiah curse (Jeremiah 22:30) disqualifies any biological descendant of Jeconiah from prospering on David's throne, yet the Davidic covenant (2 Samuel 7:12-16) requires a biological descendant of David to sit on that throne forever. Matthew's genealogy provides the legal throne right through Joseph (passing through Jeconiah); Luke's genealogy provides the biological Davidic descent through Mary (bypassing Jeconiah entirely through Nathan's line). The virgin birth is the mechanism that connects these two lines: Jesus is Joseph's legal son (inheriting the throne right) without being Joseph's biological son (thus avoiding the curse), while being Mary's biological son (fulfilling \"seed of David according to the flesh,\" Romans 1:3).</p> <p>The Greek grammar of both genealogies encodes this distinction with remarkable precision. Matthew's 39 consecutive uses of gennao in the active voice (\"X begat Y\") shift to the passive voice at exactly Matthew 1:16 (\"was born\"), with the feminine relative pronoun \"from whom\" (ex hes) pointing to Mary as the sole human source of Jesus' birth. Luke's parenthetical qualifier \"as was supposed\" (hos enomizeto, Luke 3:23) distinguishes public assumption from biological reality. These are not stylistic quirks but theological precision embedded in grammar.</p>"},{"location":"studies/genealogies-of-jesus/CONCLUSION/#key-finding-complementary-not-contradictory","title":"Key Finding: Complementary, Not Contradictory","text":"<p>The central finding of this study is that the two genealogies form an interlocking system that no single genealogy could accomplish alone. Each supplies what the other lacks:</p> <ul> <li>Matthew provides the legal royal succession but passes through the Jeconiah curse.

The verb \"begat\" that runs through the whole genealogy suddenly switches from active (\"Abraham begat Isaac\") to passive (\"Jesus was born\") at the very last entry -- Matthew 1:16.

And in Jeremiah 33:17, God says David's line will never lack a man on the throne.</p> <p>These seem contradictory: the Messiah must be a descendant of David who sits on David's throne, but no descendant of Jeconiah (who is in David's royal line) can prosper on that throne.</p> <p>Matthew's genealogy goes directly through Jeconiah (Matthew 1:11-12).
