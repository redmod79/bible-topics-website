# Bible Study: The Two Genealogies of Jesus -- Contradiction or Complementary Purpose?

## Question
Do the 2 genealogies of Jesus (Matthew 1 and Luke 3) contradict each other? Or does the context in which they are written suggest a particular meaning for each? What do Jewish culture patterns and Biblical prophecies reveal about these genealogies?

### Nave's Topics to Research (Full Entries Needed)

1. **GENEALOGY** -- Core topic. Lists genealogies from Adam to Noah, to Abraham, to Jesus (MAT 1:1-16; LUK 3:23-38). Notes genealogy of "no spiritual significance" (MAT 3:9; 1TI 1:4; TIT 3:9). Also lists genealogy of Joseph (MAT 1; LUK 3:23-38).
2. **JESUS, THE CHRIST** -- History section begins with "Genealogy of MAT 1:1-17; LUK 3:23-38." Massive entry covering entire life and ministry.
3. **DAVID** -- "Genealogy of RUT 4:18-22; 1SA 16:11; 17:12; 1CH 2:3-15; MAT 1:1-6; LUK 3:31-38." Note: Jesus called "son of David" in MAT 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 20:30,31; 21:9; 22:42; MRK 10:47,48; LUK 18:37,39. David is also a prophetic name for Christ (JER 30:9; EZK 34:23,24; 37:24,25; HOS 3:5). Prophecies about David's kingdom: 2SA 7:11-16; PSA 89:19-37; ISA 9:7; JER 23:5; LUK 1:32,33.
4. **ABRAHAM** -- Covenant promises foundational to genealogy (GEN 12:1-3; 15; 17:1-22; GAL 3:6-18,29). "In thee shall all nations be blessed" (GEN 22:18; ACT 3:25; GAL 3:8).
5. **MARY** -- Mother of Jesus (MAT 1:16; LUK 1:26-38). Prophecies concerning: ISA 7:14; LUK 2:35. Present at cross (JHN 19:25-27).

7. **SOLOMON** -- "Son of David by Bath-sheba... An ancestor of Joseph MAT 1:6." Key figure in Matthew's line (through Solomon), absent from Luke's line (through Nathan).
8. **NATHAN** -- "Son of David and Bath-sheba 2SA 5:14; 1CH 3:5; 14:4." Key figure: Nathan is David's son through whom Luke traces the genealogy, while Matthew traces through Solomon.
9. **JACOB** -- "Ancestor of Jesus MAT 1:2." Also relevant: Jacob (father of Joseph) in MAT 1:16 vs Heli (father of Joseph) in LUK 3:23.
10. **JUDAH** -- "The ancestor of Jesus MAT 1:2,3; REV 5:5." Tribe of Judah prophecy: GEN 49:10.
11. **ZERUBBABEL** -- "Called ZOROBABEL in the genealogy of Joseph MAT 1:12; LUK 3:27." Appears in both genealogies -- key convergence point.

### Related Existing Studies

| Study | Score | Relevance |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| virgin-birth-why | 0.422 | Most relevant -- discusses the virgin birth, "her seed" (Gen 3:15), the inclusion of Rahab/Ruth/Tamar/Bathsheba in Matthew 1's genealogy, and the messianic lineage as about "covenant faithfulness, not genetic purity." |
| jesus-ministry-length | 0.377 | Low relevance -- about duration of ministry |
| genesis-6-sons-of-god | 0.423 | Low relevance -- about identity of "sons of God" in Genesis 6 |

**Key findings from virgin-birth-why study:** The conclusion discusses how Matthew 1's genealogy includes four women (Rahab, Ruth, Tamar, Bathsheba) and notes this is about "covenant faithfulness, not genetic purity." It also discusses Gen 3:15 "her seed" as pointing to the virgin birth, and how "the faithful line" was preserved through unexpected means. This directly connects to the genealogy question.

### Focus Areas

1. **Matthew's genealogy: context, structure, audience, purpose**
   - Written to a Jewish audience (Gospel of Matthew)
   - Descending order: Abraham to Jesus
   - Structured in three groups of 14 generations (MAT 1:17)
   - Traces through the royal line (Solomon)
   - Includes four unusual women (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba)
   - Establishes Jesus as legal heir to David's throne through Joseph

2. **Luke's genealogy: context, structure, audience, purpose**
   - Written to Theophilus/Gentile audience (Gospel of Luke)
   - Ascending order: Jesus back to Adam, then to God
   - Placed after baptism ("Thou art my beloved Son") and before temptation
   - Traces through Nathan (son of David) instead of Solomon
   - Goes all the way back to Adam -- universal scope
   - Possibly traces Mary's biological line

3. **Points of divergence between the two lists**
   - Joseph's father: Jacob (MAT 1:16) vs Heli (LUK 3:23)
   - David to Joseph: through Solomon (Matthew) vs through Nathan (Luke)
   - Direction: descending (Matthew) vs ascending (Luke)
   - Scope: from Abraham (Matthew) vs all the way to Adam/God (Luke)
   - Zerubbabel/Salathiel appear in both but surrounding names differ

4. **OT prophecies about Messiah's lineage (Davidic, Abrahamic)**
   - Seed of woman (GEN 3:15)
   - Through Abraham (GEN 12:3; 22:18)
   - Through Judah (GEN 49:10)
   - Through David (2SA 7:12-16; PSA 89:3,4; ISA 9:7; JER 23:5)
   - From Bethlehem (MIC 5:2)
   - Star out of Jacob (NUM 24:17)
   - The Jeconiah curse problem (JER 22:24-30) and how the two genealogies resolve it

5. **Jewish cultural practices around genealogy, legal vs biological descent**
   - Levirate marriage (DEU 25:5-10) -- a man could have both a legal father and biological father
   - Legal adoption and inheritance rights through marriage
   - Daughters' inheritance rights (NUM 27:6-11; 36:6-9)
   - The significance of tribal records and genealogical enrollment (NUM 1:18; NEH 7:5)
   - How a son-in-law could be listed as a "son" in Jewish reckoning

6. **How the two genealogies together fulfill prophecy**
   - Matthew establishes legal/royal right to David's throne (through Joseph)
   - Luke may establish biological descent from David (through Mary)
   - Together they solve the Jeconiah curse: legal right through Joseph (Matthew), but biological descent bypasses the curse through Nathan's line (Luke)
   - Both confirm descent from David, Abraham, and Judah

7. **The role of women in Matthew's genealogy (unusual for Jewish genealogies)**
   - Tamar (GEN 38) -- Gentile connection, irregular circumstances
   - Rahab (JOS 2) -- Canaanite prostitute who had faith
   - Ruth (RUT 1-4) -- Moabitess, covenant faithfulness
   - Bathsheba ("her that had been the wife of Urias") -- Hittite connection
   - Mary -- virgin, Holy Spirit conception
   - Pattern: God's grace working through unexpected, often non-Jewish women
   - Foreshadows the gospel going to Gentiles
