# Simple Conclusion: The Two Genealogies of Jesus

---

## Introduction

Why does Jesus have two different family trees in the Bible? Matthew 1 and Luke 3 both trace Jesus' ancestry, but through different names, in different directions, and with different endpoints. Skeptics have long pointed to these differences as proof of biblical error. But a closer look reveals something far more interesting: the two genealogies are not competing accounts -- they are complementary records that together solve a problem no single genealogy could.

---

## The Basic Difference

**Matthew** starts with Abraham, moves forward through King David and his son Solomon, then through the kings of Judah, down to Joseph, "the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus" (Matthew 1:16).

**Luke** starts with Jesus and works backward -- past Joseph, past a man named Heli, through David's son Nathan (not Solomon), all the way back to Adam and ultimately to God (Luke 3:38).

The lists share some names (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David), but after David they diverge almost completely. Matthew goes through Solomon; Luke goes through Nathan. Matthew lists Jacob as Joseph's father; Luke lists Heli.

**Orange path** = Matthew's legal royal line (through Solomon and the kings).
**Green path** = Luke's biological line (through Nathan, bypassing the curse).
Both converge at Jesus through the virgin birth.

## Why Two Different Lines?

The most widely held explanation is that Matthew traces Joseph's legal lineage (the royal succession to the throne), while Luke traces Mary's biological lineage (Jesus' actual blood descent from David).

Several clues support this:

- **Matthew** calls Joseph "the husband of Mary" and never calls him Jesus' father. The verb "begat" that runs through the whole genealogy suddenly switches from active ("Abraham begat Isaac") to passive ("Jesus was born") at the very last entry -- Matthew 1:16. This grammatical shift signals that Joseph did not father Jesus the way all the previous fathers had fathered their sons.

- **Luke** inserts a parenthetical note: Jesus was "as was supposed" the son of Joseph (Luke 3:23). The Greek phrase means "as was publicly reckoned" -- distinguishing what people assumed from what was biologically true. If Luke is actually tracing Mary's line, then Heli would be Mary's father, and Joseph would be called "son of Heli" as his son-in-law (a common practice in Jewish genealogical reckoning).

## The Curse That Made Two Lines Necessary

Here is where it gets remarkable. In Jeremiah 22:30, God declares a curse on King Jeconiah (also called Coniah): "No man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David." No biological descendant of Jeconiah could successfully reign as king.

But in 2 Samuel 7:12-16, God promised David that his descendant would sit on his throne forever. And in Jeremiah 33:17, God says David's line will never lack a man on the throne.

These seem contradictory: the Messiah must be a descendant of David who sits on David's throne, but no descendant of Jeconiah (who is in David's royal line) can prosper on that throne.

Matthew's genealogy goes directly through Jeconiah (Matthew 1:11-12). If Jesus were Joseph's biological son, he would inherit the curse and be disqualified from the throne. But because of the virgin birth, Jesus is Joseph's legal son (inheriting the right to the throne) without being his biological son (avoiding the curse).

Luke's genealogy bypasses Jeconiah entirely by tracing through Nathan, another son of David who was never part of the royal line. Through Mary, Jesus is biologically descended from David -- but through an uncursed line.

The two genealogies together are the only way to simultaneously satisfy both promises: legal right to the throne (through Solomon's royal line via Joseph) and biological descent from David without the curse (through Nathan's line via Mary).

## What the Grammar Tells Us

The original Greek of both genealogies encodes the virgin birth with precision:

- In Matthew, the word "begat" (*egennesen*, active voice) is used 39 times in a row. At verse 16, it suddenly switches to "was born" (*egennethe*, passive voice), and the pronoun "of whom" is feminine singular -- pointing to Mary alone as the human source of Jesus' birth.

- In Luke, the phrase "as was supposed" (*hos enomizeto*) uses the imperfect passive tense, indicating an ongoing public assumption -- not a statement of biological fact.

These are not stylistic accidents. They are grammatical markers that distinguish legal relationship from biological parentage.

## The Prophecies They Fulfill Together

Neither genealogy alone could fulfill all the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's lineage. Together, they fulfill every one:

- **Seed of the woman** (Genesis 3:15) -- the virgin birth, encoded in both genealogies
- **Blessing through Abraham's seed** (Genesis 12:3) -- both lines trace through Abraham
- **Scepter from Judah** (Genesis 49:10) -- both trace through Judah
- **David's seed on an eternal throne** (2 Samuel 7:12-16) -- Matthew provides the legal throne right; Luke provides the biological descent
- **Born of a virgin** (Isaiah 7:14) -- both genealogies encode the virgin birth grammatically
- **A righteous Branch who prospers** (Jeremiah 23:5) -- possible only if not biologically from Jeconiah

---

## What About the "Contradiction"?

A genuine contradiction requires two accounts making the same claim in incompatible ways. These genealogies do not make the same claim. Matthew is documenting the legal royal succession; Luke is documenting biological descent. The points where they differ -- Joseph's father, the line from David, the direction and scope -- are precisely the points where complementary perspectives are needed.

One genealogy could not do what these two do together. Matthew alone would leave Jesus under Jeconiah's curse. Luke alone would provide no legal claim to the throne. The virgin birth is the mechanism that connects them: Jesus is Joseph's legal heir (inheriting the throne) without being Joseph's biological son (avoiding the curse), while being Mary's biological son (fulfilling "made of the seed of David according to the flesh," Romans 1:3).

---

## Conclusion

The two genealogies of Jesus are not an error -- they are an interlocking system. Each supplies what the other lacks. Together they demonstrate that Jesus of Nazareth is the only person who could simultaneously be the legal heir to David's throne and a biological descendant of David through an uncursed line. The virgin birth is not an add-on to the genealogies; it is the event that makes both genealogies work together.

God preserved both records because both are necessary.
