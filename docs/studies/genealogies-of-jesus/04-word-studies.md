# Word Studies: Genealogies of Jesus

## gennao - G1080
**Original:** Greek -- gennao (transliteration: gennao)
**Definition:** To procreate (properly, of the father, but by extension of the mother); figuratively, to regenerate. Used 97 times in NT (BLB count). 74 occurrences in KJV text with 24 unique translations.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| begat | 40 | 54.1% |
| was born | 4 | 5.4% |
| born | 4 | 5.4% |
| begotten | 3 | 4.1% |
| had | 2 | 2.7% |
| been born | 2 | 2.7% |
| have | 2 | 2.7% |

**Critical observation:** 39 of 40 occurrences of "begat" are in Matthew 1:2-16 (the genealogy). The only other NT "begat" is Acts 7:8 (Abraham begat Isaac). This word dominates Matthew's genealogy structure.

### Key Verses (top 8)
- **Matthew 1:2** -- "Abraham **begat** [egennesen, Active Aorist] Isaac; and Isaac **begat** Jacob; and Jacob **begat** Judas and his brethren"
- **Matthew 1:6** -- "And Jesse **begat** David the king; and David the king **begat** Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias"
- **Matthew 1:16** -- "And Jacob **begat** [egennesen, Active Aorist] Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom **was born** [egennethe, Passive Aorist] Jesus, who is called Christ."
- **Matthew 1:20** -- "that which is **conceived** [gennethein] in her is of the Holy Ghost"
- **Luke 1:35** -- "that holy thing which shall be **born** of thee shall be called the Son of God"
- **Acts 7:8** -- "Abraham **begat** Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day"
- **Acts 13:33** -- "Thou art my Son, this day have I **begotten** thee"
- **1 John 5:1** -- "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is **born** of God"

### Grammatical Significance in Matthew 1:16
In Matthew's genealogy, gennao appears in the **Active Aorist Indicative** (egennesen = "X begat Y") 39 times consecutively. At verse 16, when it reaches Jesus, the verb shifts to the **Passive Aorist Indicative** (egennethe = "was born"). This grammatical shift breaks the "X begat Y" pattern precisely at Jesus, indicating that Joseph did not "beget" Jesus in the same way the preceding fathers begat their sons.

## huios - G5207
**Original:** Greek -- huios (transliteration: huios)
**Definition:** A "son" (sometimes of animals), used very widely of immediate, remote, or figuratively, kinship: child, foal, son. Masculine noun. 382 occurrences (BLB count); 299 in KJV with 22 unique translations.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Son (capitalized, referring to Jesus) | 131 | 43.8% |
| son | 47 | 15.7% |
| children | 29 | 9.7% |
| sons | 20 | 6.7% |
| the Son | 16 | 5.4% |
| the children | 14 | 4.7% |
| the son | 12 | 4.0% |
| a son | 11 | 3.7% |

### Key Verses (top 8)
- **Luke 3:23** -- "And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the **son** [huios] of Joseph, which was the son of Heli"
- **Matthew 1:1** -- "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the **son** [huiou, genitive] of David, the **son** [huiou] of Abraham"
- **Matthew 1:25** -- "and he... knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn **son**: and he called his name JESUS"
- **Matthew 22:42** -- "What think ye of Christ? whose **son** is he? They say unto him, The **Son** of David."
- **Matthew 22:45** -- "If David then call him Lord, how is he his **son**?"
- **Romans 1:3** -- "Concerning his **Son** Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh"
- **Luke 1:32** -- "He shall be great, and shall be called the **Son** of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David"
- **Galatians 4:4** -- "God sent forth his **Son**, made of a woman, made under the law"

### Usage in Luke 3:23
In Luke 3:23, huios appears in the nominative case (the subject form). The phrase "being [on] son [huios], as was supposed [enomizeto], of Joseph" uses huios without the definite article, leaving it ambiguous whether "son" indicates biological descent, legal sonship, or son-in-law relationship.

## ben - H1121
**Original:** Hebrew -- ben (transliteration: ben)
**Definition:** A son (as a builder of the family name), in the widest sense of literal and figurative relationship, including grandson, subject, nation, quality or condition, etc. From banah (H1129, to build). Masculine noun. 5,092 occurrences in KJV with 398 unique translations.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| the son | 1,147 | 22.5% |
| the children | 717 | 14.1% |
| of the children | 310 | 6.1% |
| the sons | 221 | 4.3% |
| his son | 210 | 4.1% |
| sons | 164 | 3.2% |
| son | 158 | 3.1% |
| old (as in "years old") | 134 | 2.6% |

### Key Verses (top 8)
- **Genesis 49:10** -- "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come"
- **2 Samuel 7:14** -- "I will be his father, and he shall be my **son**"
- **1 Chronicles 3:1** -- "Now these were the **sons** of David, which were born unto him in Hebron"
- **Psalm 2:7** -- "Thou art my **Son**; this day have I begotten thee"
- **Psalm 89:23** -- (in Davidic covenant context)
- **Isaiah 9:6** -- "For unto us a child is born, unto us a **son** is given"
- **Proverbs 30:4** -- "what is his **son's** name, if thou canst tell?"
- **1 Chronicles 17:13** -- "I will be his father, and he shall be my **son**"

### Semantic Range
Ben (H1121) has an extraordinarily wide semantic range in Hebrew, far broader than the English word "son." It can mean: biological son, grandson, descendant (remote), member of a group ("sons of Israel" = Israelites), quality ("son of wickedness" = wicked person), age ("son of thirty years" = thirty years old), and even animals ("son of the herd" = calf). This breadth is critical for understanding OT genealogies, where "son" may skip generations.

## yalad - H3205
**Original:** Hebrew -- yalad (transliteration: yalad)
**Definition:** A primitive root; to bear young; causatively, to beget; medically, to act as midwife; specifically, to show lineage. Verb. 498 occurrences (BLB count); 540 in KJV with 179 unique translations.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| begat | 106 | 19.6% |
| bare | 41 | 7.6% |
| and begat | 36 | 6.7% |
| and bare | 24 | 4.4% |
| he begat | 17 | 3.1% |
| were born | 17 | 3.1% |

| and she bare | 12 | 2.2% |

### Key Verses (top 8)
- **Genesis 5:3** -- "And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and **begat** a son in his own likeness"
- **Ruth 4:18** -- "Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez **begat** Hezron"
- **1 Chronicles 2:10** -- "And Ram **begat** Amminadab; and Amminadab **begat** Nahshon"
- **1 Chronicles 3:1** -- "Now these were the sons of David, which were **born** unto him in Hebron"
- **1 Chronicles 3:5** -- "And these were **born** unto him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel"
- **Genesis 10:8** -- "And Cush **begat** Nimrod"
- **Psalm 2:7** -- "Thou art my Son; this day have I **begotten** [yalad] thee"
- **Isaiah 9:6** -- "For unto us a child is **born** [yullad, passive], unto us a son is given"

### Comparison with G1080
Yalad (H3205) is the Hebrew equivalent of Greek gennao (G1080). Both cover the semantic range of "beget/bear/be born." The OT genealogies in Genesis 5, 10, 11 and 1 Chronicles 1-3 use yalad in the same "X begat Y" pattern that Matthew uses with gennao. Matthew's genealogy is deliberately constructed in the OT pattern, making the voice shift at 1:16 (from active to passive) all the more striking.

## zera - H2233
**Original:** Hebrew -- zera (transliteration: zera)
**Definition:** Seed; figuratively, fruit, plant, sowing-time, posterity. From zara (H2232, to sow). Masculine noun. 229 occurrences (BLB count); 242 in KJV with 68 unique translations.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| seed | 46 | 19.0% |
| thy seed | 29 | 12.0% |
| the seed | 20 | 8.3% |
| of the seed | 9 | 3.7% |
| of thy seed | 8 | 3.3% |
| his seed | 8 | 3.3% |
| and his seed | 8 | 3.3% |
| and to thy seed | 7 | 2.9% |

### Key Verses (top 8)
- **Genesis 3:15** -- "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy **seed** and her **seed**; it shall bruise thy head"
- **Genesis 12:7** -- "Unto thy **seed** will I give this land"
- **Genesis 22:18** -- "And in thy **seed** shall all the nations of the earth be blessed"
- **2 Samuel 7:12** -- "I will set up thy **seed** after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels"
- **Jeremiah 23:5** -- (context: the righteous Branch raised to David)

- **Jeremiah 33:26** -- "then will I cast away the **seed** of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his **seed**"
- **Psalm 89:4** -- "Thy **seed** will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne"

### Messianic Significance
Zera is the word used for "seed" in the foundational messianic prophecy of Genesis 3:15 ("her seed"), the Abrahamic covenant (Genesis 22:18, "in thy seed"), and the Davidic covenant (2 Samuel 7:12, "thy seed"). The Greek equivalent in the NT is sperma (G4690). Paul explicitly identifies this "seed" as Christ in Galatians 3:16.

---

## sperma - G4690
**Original:** Greek -- sperma (transliteration: sperma)
**Definition:** Something sown, i.e. seed (including the male "sperm"); by implication, offspring, posterity. Neuter noun. 44 occurrences (BLB count); 40 in KJV with 7 unique translations.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| seed | 27 | 67.5% |
| the seed | 7 | 17.5% |
| seeds | 2 | 5.0% |
| issue | 1 | 2.5% |
| any seed | 1 | 2.5% |
| a seed | 1 | 2.5% |
| to seeds | 1 | 2.5% |

### Key Verses (top 8)
- **Romans 1:3** -- "Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the **seed** [spermatos] of David according to the flesh"
- **Galatians 3:16** -- "Now to Abraham and his **seed** were the promises made. He saith not, And to **seeds**, as of many; but as of one, And to thy **seed**, which is Christ."
- **Acts 13:23** -- "Of this man's **seed** hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus"
- **John 7:42** -- "Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the **seed** of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem"
- **2 Timothy 2:8** -- "Remember that Jesus Christ of the **seed** of David was raised from the dead"
- **Hebrews 2:16** -- "For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the **seed** of Abraham"
- **Romans 9:7** -- "Neither, because they are the **seed** of Abraham, are they all children"
- **Matthew 22:24** -- "If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up **seed** unto his brother"

### Connection to Genealogies
Sperma (G4690) is the NT word that links Jesus to the Davidic and Abrahamic covenants. Romans 1:3 ("seed of David according to the flesh"), Acts 13:23 ("of this man's seed"), and Galatians 3:16 ("thy seed, which is Christ") all use this word to establish Jesus' physical descent as fulfillment of OT promises. The word demands actual physical descent -- it is not merely a title.

## towledah - H8435
**Original:** Hebrew -- towledah (transliteration: towledah)
**Definition:** Descent, i.e. family; (figuratively) history. From yalad (H3205). Feminine noun. 39 occurrences in KJV with 12 unique translations.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| by their generations | 14 | 35.9% |
| the generations | 11 | 28.2% |
| according to their generations | 4 | 10.3% |
| throughout their generations | 2 | 5.1% |
| of the generations | 1 | 2.6% |
| according to their birth | 1 | 2.6% |

### Key Verses (top 8)
- **Genesis 2:4** -- "These are the **generations** of the heavens and of the earth"
- **Genesis 5:1** -- "This is the book of the **generations** of Adam"
- **Genesis 11:10** -- "These are the **generations** of Shem"
- **Genesis 11:27** -- "Now these are the **generations** of Terah"
- **Genesis 25:19** -- "And these are the **generations** of Isaac"
- **Genesis 37:2** -- "These are the **generations** of Jacob"
- **Ruth 4:18** -- "Now these are the **generations** of Pharez" (leads to David's genealogy)
- **Numbers 1:20** -- "the children of Reuben... by their **generations**"

### Structural Term
Towledah is the Hebrew structural marker for genealogical records. The phrase "these are the generations of..." (elleh toledoth) appears 11 times in Genesis alone, functioning as section headings. Genesis 5:1 ("the book of the generations of Adam") provides the structural pattern that Matthew 1:1 echoes: "The book of the generation [genesis, G1078] of Jesus Christ."

## patria - G3965
**Original:** Greek -- patria (transliteration: patria)
**Definition:** Paternal descent, i.e. (concretely) a group of families or a whole race (nation). From pater (G3962, father). Feminine noun. 3 occurrences in KJV with 3 unique translations.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| lineage | 1 | 33.3% |
| kindreds | 1 | 33.3% |
| family | 1 | 33.3% |

### Key Verses (all 3)
- **Luke 2:4** -- "And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and **lineage** [patrias] of David:)"
- **Acts 3:25** -- "in thy seed shall all the **kindreds** [patriai] of the earth be blessed"
- **Ephesians 3:15** -- "Of whom the whole **family** [patria] in heaven and earth is named"

### Significance
Patria derives from pater (father) and denotes specifically paternal descent -- lineage traced through the father. Luke 2:4 uses this word to describe Joseph's connection to David, confirming that Joseph's lineage (whether in Matthew or Luke) was understood as establishing Jesus' legal connection to David's house through the father's line.

## genesis - G1078
**Original:** Greek -- genesis (transliteration: genesis)
**Definition:** Nativity; figuratively, nature. From the same root as ginomai (G1096, to become). Feminine noun. 3 occurrences (BLB count); 1 translated "generation" in KJV.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| of the generation | 1 | 100% |

### Key Verses (all NT occurrences)
- **Matthew 1:1** -- "The book of the **generation** [geneseos] of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham"
- **Matthew 1:18** -- "Now the birth [genesis] of Jesus Christ was on this wise"
- **James 1:23** -- "beholding his natural face [lit. the face of his genesis/birth]"
- **James 3:6** -- "setteth on fire the course [lit. wheel of genesis/nature] of nature"

### Connection to OT Pattern
Genesis (G1078) in Matthew 1:1 directly echoes the LXX (Septuagint) usage of the same word in Genesis 2:4 and 5:1, where towledah (H8435) is translated as genesis. Matthew's opening phrase "biblos geneseos" ("book of the generation") mirrors Genesis 5:1 LXX: "haute he biblos geneseos" ("this is the book of the generation"). This deliberate literary echo signals that Matthew is constructing a new "Genesis" -- the genesis/origin of the Messiah.

---

## genealogeo - G1075
**Original:** Greek -- genealogeo (transliteration: genealogeo)
**Definition:** To reckon by generations, i.e. trace in genealogy. Verb. 1 occurrence (BLB count); 2 translations in KJV.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| he whose descent is | 1 | 50% |
| counted | 1 | 50% |

### Key Verse
- **Hebrews 7:6** -- "But he whose descent is not **counted** [genealogoumenos, passive participle] from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises"

### Significance
This is the verb form of "genealogy." In Hebrews 7:6, it is used of Melchizedek, whose genealogy is deliberately unrecorded. The passive voice ("whose descent is not counted") implies genealogical reckoning was a deliberate, official process in Jewish culture -- not mere family memory.

---

## genealogia - G1076
**Original:** Greek -- genealogia (transliteration: genealogia)
**Definition:** Tracing by generations, i.e. genealogy. Feminine noun. 2 occurrences in KJV.

### Key Translations
| Translation | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| genealogies | 2 | 100% |

### Key Verses (both)
- **1 Timothy 1:4** -- "Neither give heed to fables and endless **genealogies**, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith"
- **Titus 3:9** -- "But avoid foolish questions, and **genealogies**, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain"

### Context
Paul's warnings about "genealogies" use this specific Greek word. These warnings are directed at speculative genealogical disputes (likely related to Gnostic or Jewish-mythological elaborations), not at the legitimate genealogies recorded in Matthew 1 and Luke 3. The word "endless" (aperantos) in 1 Timothy 1:4 suggests speculative, fabricated genealogies rather than the biblical records.

## Greek Grammar Analysis

### Matthew 1:16 -- Voice Shift in gennao
**Greek Text:** Iakob de **egennesen** ton Ioseph ton andra Marias, ex hes **egennethe** Iesous ho legomenos Christos.

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| egennesen | gennao | G1080 | Aorist Active Indicative, 3rd person singular |
| ton Ioseph | Ioseph | G2501 | Accusative Singular Masculine (direct object of "begat") |
| ton andra | aner | G435 | Accusative Singular Masculine ("the husband") |
| Marias | Maria | G3137 | Genitive Singular Feminine ("of Mary") |
| ex hes | hos | G3739 | Genitive Singular Feminine ("from whom" -- feminine, referring to Mary) |
| egennethe | gennao | G1080 | Aorist Passive Indicative, 3rd person singular |
| Iesous | Iesous | G2424 | Nominative Singular Masculine (subject of passive verb) |
| ho legomenos | lego | G3004 | Present Passive Participle, Nominative Singular Masculine ("the one being called") |
| Christos | Christos | G5547 | Nominative Singular Masculine |

**Key observations:**
1. **egennesen** (Active) = "begat" -- Jacob is the agent who begets Joseph
2. **egennethe** (Passive) = "was born" -- Jesus is the one born, but no male agent is named
3. **ex hes** (feminine relative pronoun) = "from whom (fem.)" -- refers to Mary, not Joseph
4. **ton andra Marias** = "the husband of Mary" -- Joseph is identified by his relationship to Mary, not as Jesus' father

### Luke 3:23 -- The Parenthetical Qualifier
**Greek Text:** Kai autos en Iesous archomenos hosei eton triakonta, on huios, hos enomizeto, Ioseph, tou Heli

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| on | eimi | G1510 | Present Active Participle, Nominative Singular Masculine ("being") |
| huios | huios | G5207 | Nominative Singular Masculine ("son") |
| hos | hos | G5613 | Adverb ("as") |
| enomizeto | nomizo | G3543 | Imperfect Passive Indicative, 3rd person singular ("was supposed/reckoned") |
| Ioseph | Ioseph | G2501 | Genitive Singular Masculine |
| tou Heli | Heli | G2242 | Genitive Singular Masculine (with definite article) |

**Key observations:**
1. **hos enomizeto** = "as was supposed/reckoned" -- a parenthetical qualification
2. **enomizeto** (Imperfect Passive) = "was being supposed" -- ongoing public assumption, not a statement of fact
3. The genitive chain (tou Heli, tou Maththat, etc.) continues without repeating "son" -- a standard Jewish genealogical construction meaning "of Heli, of Matthat, etc."
4. The qualifier "as was supposed" may apply only to the Joseph connection, not to the entire genealogy, suggesting Heli may be Jesus' actual grandfather through Mary

### Matthew 1:1 -- The Opening Formula
**Greek Text:** Biblos geneseos Iesou Christou huiou Daueid huiou Abraam.

| Word | Lemma | Strong's | Parsing |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Biblos | biblos | G976 | Nominative Singular Feminine ("book/record") |
| geneseos | genesis | G1078 | Genitive Singular Feminine ("of the generation/origin") |
| huiou | huios | G5207 | Genitive Singular Masculine ("of the son") -- appears twice |
| Daueid | Dauid | G1138 | Genitive Singular Masculine |
| Abraam | Abraam | G11 | Genitive Singular Masculine |

**Key observations:**
1. **Biblos geneseos** = "book/record of the origin/generation" -- echoes Genesis 5:1 LXX
2. **huiou Daueid huiou Abraam** = "son of David, son of Abraham" -- genitive chain establishing dual lineage claim
3. David is listed before Abraham (reverse chronological order), emphasizing royal Davidic descent as primary

### Matthew 1:2 -- The Standard Pattern
**Greek Text:** Abraam egennesen ton Isaak, Isaak de egennesen ton Iakob, Iakob de egennesen ton Ioudan kai tous adelphous autou.

All three instances of **egennesen** parse identically: Aorist Active Indicative, 3rd person singular of gennao (G1080). This establishes the pattern: Subject (Nominative) + egennesen (Active verb) + Object (Accusative with article ton). This active pattern continues unbroken for 39 uses until it shifts to passive at 1:16.
