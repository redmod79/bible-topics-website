# Conclusion: The Two Genealogies of Jesus

## Summary

The two genealogies of Jesus in Matthew 1:1-17 and Luke 3:23-38 are not contradictory but complementary records serving distinct purposes for distinct audiences. Matthew, writing to a Jewish audience, presents a descending genealogy from Abraham through David through Solomon through the kings of Judah to Joseph, establishing Jesus' legal right to the throne of David as the promised Messianic King. Luke, writing to Theophilus (a Gentile), presents an ascending genealogy from Jesus backward through David's son Nathan all the way to Adam and to God, establishing Jesus' biological descent from David and his connection to all humanity as Savior of the world.

The differences between the two genealogies -- Joseph's father (Jacob in Matthew, Heli in Luke), the line from David (Solomon in Matthew, Nathan in Luke), the direction and scope -- are not errors but intentional features that together resolve what would otherwise be an impossible theological problem. The Jeconiah curse (Jeremiah 22:30) disqualifies any biological descendant of Jeconiah from prospering on David's throne, yet the Davidic covenant (2 Samuel 7:12-16) requires a biological descendant of David to sit on that throne forever. Matthew's genealogy provides the legal throne right through Joseph (passing through Jeconiah); Luke's genealogy provides the biological Davidic descent through Mary (bypassing Jeconiah entirely through Nathan's line). The virgin birth is the mechanism that connects these two lines: Jesus is Joseph's legal son (inheriting the throne right) without being Joseph's biological son (thus avoiding the curse), while being Mary's biological son (fulfilling "seed of David according to the flesh," Romans 1:3).

The Greek grammar of both genealogies encodes this distinction with remarkable precision. Matthew's 39 consecutive uses of gennao in the active voice ("X begat Y") shift to the passive voice at exactly Matthew 1:16 ("was born"), with the feminine relative pronoun "from whom" (ex hes) pointing to Mary as the sole human source of Jesus' birth. Luke's parenthetical qualifier "as was supposed" (hos enomizeto, Luke 3:23) distinguishes public assumption from biological reality. These are not stylistic quirks but theological precision embedded in grammar.

## Key Finding: Complementary, Not Contradictory

The central finding of this study is that the two genealogies form an interlocking system that no single genealogy could accomplish alone. Each supplies what the other lacks:

- Matthew provides the **legal royal succession** but passes through the Jeconiah curse. Luke provides the **biological Davidic line** that bypasses the curse.
- Matthew establishes Jesus as **Israel's promised King** (Son of David, Son of Abraham). Luke establishes Jesus as **humanity's Savior** (son of Adam, son of God).
- Matthew encodes the virgin birth through the **active-to-passive voice shift** in the genealogical verb. Luke encodes it through the **parenthetical qualifier** "as was supposed."
- Matthew includes **four women** (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba) who foreshadow both Mary and the inclusion of Gentiles. Luke includes **no women** but extends the line to Adam, encompassing all nations.

A genuine contradiction requires two accounts making the same claim in incompatible ways. These genealogies do not make the same claim -- they make complementary claims from different angles, and the points where they differ are precisely the points where complementary perspectives are needed.

## Matthew's Genealogy: The Legal Royal Line

Matthew opens his Gospel with "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham" (Matthew 1:1), echoing the Septuagint's rendering of Genesis 5:1 ("This is the book of the generations of Adam"). The phrase biblos geneseos (G1078) signals a new "genesis" -- the origin of the Messiah.

The genealogy traces the official kingly succession: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, through Boaz and Ruth, through Jesse to David the king, then through Solomon, Rehoboam, and the succeeding kings of Judah, through the exile (including Jeconiah), down to "Jacob [who] begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ" (Matthew 1:16).

Key features:
- **Three groups of 14 generations** (Matthew 1:17), with 14 being the gematria value of David's name in Hebrew
- **Four women** included (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba) -- each involved in irregular circumstances, each with Gentile connections
- **Voice shift** at verse 16: the verb gennao (G1080) shifts from Active Aorist (egennesen, "begat") to Passive Aorist (egennethe, "was born"), signaling that Joseph did not beget Jesus in the way the preceding fathers begat their sons
- **Joseph identified as "the husband of Mary"** rather than as Jesus' father
- **Immediate context**: the virgin birth narrative follows (Matthew 1:18-25), confirming what the grammar implies

## Luke's Genealogy: The Biological Line Through Mary

Luke places his genealogy after Jesus' baptism, where the voice from heaven declares "Thou art my beloved Son" (Luke 3:22), and before the temptation, where Satan challenges "If thou be the Son of God" (Luke 4:3, 9). The genealogy answers the question: who is this "beloved Son"?

Luke traces backward from Jesus through names entirely different from Matthew's post-David list, through Nathan (a non-royal son of David and Bathsheba, 1 Chronicles 3:5), past Abraham to Adam and ultimately to God (Luke 3:38).

Key features:
- **Parenthetical qualifier**: "being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph" (Luke 3:23) -- the Greek hos enomizeto (Imperfect Passive of nomizo, G3543) signals public assumption, not biological fact
- **Through Nathan, not Solomon** (Luke 3:31): bypasses the royal line and the Jeconiah curse entirely
- **Joseph's father is Heli** (Luke 3:23), not Jacob (Matthew 1:16) -- if Luke traces Mary's line, Heli may be Mary's father, with Joseph reckoned as "son of Heli" as his son-in-law
- **Extends to Adam and to God** (Luke 3:38): universal scope for a Gentile audience
- **No women named**: follows the standard Jewish genealogical form using the genitive chain ("of Heli, of Matthat, of Levi...")

## The Jeconiah Problem and Its Resolution

Jeremiah 22:30 declares: "Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah."

Matthew's genealogy passes directly through Jeconiah (Matthew 1:11-12). If Jesus were Joseph's biological son, he would be Jeconiah's biological descendant and disqualified from the throne. But the virgin birth means Jesus is not Joseph's biological son -- he inherits the legal right to the throne through Joseph without inheriting the biological curse.

Meanwhile, Luke's genealogy traces through Nathan, David's son who never entered the royal succession. This line has no connection to Jeconiah. If Luke traces Mary's biological line, then Jesus is biologically descended from David through a completely uncursed line.

The two genealogies together resolve the paradox created by two seemingly contradictory Jeremianic prophecies: Jeremiah 22:30 (no descendant of Jeconiah on the throne) and Jeremiah 33:17-21 (David's line will never lack a man on the throne). The resolution requires both a legal connection to the throne (through Jeconiah's line, via Joseph) and a biological connection to David that avoids the curse (through Nathan's line, via Mary), joined by the virgin birth.

## Prophecies Fulfilled Through Two Lines

The two genealogies together fulfill every major OT lineage prophecy:

| Prophecy | Verse | Fulfillment |
|---|---|---|
| Seed of the woman | Genesis 3:15 | Virgin birth encoded in both genealogies (voice shift, "as was supposed") |
| Blessing through Abraham's seed | Genesis 12:3; 22:18 | Both genealogies trace through Abraham |
| Scepter from Judah | Genesis 49:10 | Both trace through Judah |
| Star out of Jacob | Numbers 24:17 | Both trace through Jacob/Israel |
| David's seed on eternal throne | 2 Samuel 7:12-16 | Matthew: legal throne right; Luke: biological descent |
| Born of a virgin | Isaiah 7:14 | Matthew 1:22-23 cites this; both genealogies encode it grammatically |
| Child born, Son given, on David's throne | Isaiah 9:6-7 | "Born" (biological, Luke's line); "given" (divine); throne (Matthew's legal line) |
| Rod from stem of Jesse | Isaiah 11:1 | Both trace through Jesse (Matthew 1:5-6; Luke 3:32) |
| Righteous Branch who prospers | Jeremiah 23:5 | Can prosper only if not biologically from Jeconiah -- Luke's line resolves this |
| David's line never cut off | Jeremiah 33:17-21 | Both lines preserve Davidic descent |
| From Bethlehem | Micah 5:2 | Joseph and Mary both travel to Bethlehem (Luke 2:4), Joseph as "house and lineage of David" |

## Jewish Cultural Context from Scripture

Biblical law provides the framework for understanding how a man could have two "fathers" and how a woman's genealogy could be reckoned:

- **Levirate marriage** (Deuteronomy 25:5-10): A child could have a legal father (the deceased brother) and a biological father (the brother who performed the levirate duty). This established the principle of dual fatherhood in Jewish culture.
- **Daughters' inheritance** (Numbers 27:7-8): When a man died without sons, his daughters inherited. This meant a woman's genealogical line could carry the father's inheritance.
- **Marriage within tribe for heiresses** (Numbers 36:6-7): Heiress daughters were required to marry within their tribe, preserving tribal identity. If Mary was an heiress of Heli (who had no sons), she was required to marry within Judah's tribe and David's family -- which Joseph, being of the house of David (Luke 2:4), satisfied.
- **Ruth 4:1-22**: The kinsman-redeemer marriage of Boaz and Ruth (a Moabitess) within Jesus' own genealogy demonstrates that the Messianic line included non-standard descent.
- **Genesis 38**: Tamar's irregular union with Judah produced Pharez, through whom David (and Jesus) descended.

## Key Verses That Illuminate the Genealogies

1. **Matthew 1:16** -- "Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus" -- voice shift from active to passive gennao
2. **Luke 3:23** -- "being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli" -- parenthetical qualifier distinguishing public assumption from fact
3. **Romans 1:3** -- "made of the seed of David according to the flesh" -- demands biological Davidic descent
4. **Acts 2:30** -- "of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne" -- biological descent AND throne occupancy
5. **Jeremiah 22:30** -- "no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David" -- the Jeconiah curse
6. **2 Samuel 7:12-16** -- "I will set up thy seed... I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever" -- the Davidic covenant
7. **Genesis 3:15** -- "her seed" -- anomalous attribution of seed to the woman, pointing to virgin birth
8. **Isaiah 7:14** -- "a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son" -- cited in Matthew 1:22-23
9. **Galatians 3:16** -- "And to thy seed, which is Christ" -- identifies the singular seed of Abraham as Christ
10. **1 Chronicles 3:5** -- "Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua" -- both Nathan and Solomon are sons of David and Bathsheba
11. **Luke 1:32** -- "the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David" -- the angel identifies the throne as David's, given to Jesus
12. **Galatians 4:4** -- "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law" -- born of a woman, within the Jewish legal framework
13. **Revelation 22:16** -- "I am the root and the offspring of David" -- Jesus is both David's source and David's descendant
14. **Hebrews 7:14** -- "it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda" -- tribal identity publicly known

## The Greek Grammar Evidence

**Matthew 1:16** -- The verb gennao (G1080) appears 39 times in the Active Aorist Indicative (egennesen, "begat") throughout Matthew 1:2-15. At verse 16, it shifts to the Passive Aorist Indicative (egennethe, "was born"). The relative pronoun ex hes ("from whom") is feminine singular, referring to Mary. Joseph is called "the husband of Mary" (ton andra Marias), not the father of Jesus. This grammatical shift is the genealogical encoding of the virgin birth.

**Luke 3:23** -- The verb nomizo (G3543) appears in the Imperfect Passive Indicative (enomizeto, "was being supposed"), inserted parenthetically between "being son" (on huios) and "of Joseph" (Ioseph). This qualifies the Joseph-Jesus connection as a matter of ongoing public reckoning, not biological fact. The genitive chain that follows (tou Heli, tou Maththat...) may trace a different line -- possibly Mary's -- once the Joseph parenthetical is understood as a qualifier.

**Matthew 1:1** -- The phrase biblos geneseos (G976, G1078) mirrors the Septuagint's rendering of Genesis 5:1 (Hebrew: sepher toledoth), signaling that Matthew is constructing a "book of origins" for the Messiah in the pattern of the OT genealogical records.

## What Would Be Lost Without Both Genealogies

Without Matthew's genealogy, we would lack:
- The legal royal succession from Solomon through the kings of Judah to Joseph
- The structured three-by-fourteen presentation embedding David's name numerically
- The four women (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba) who foreshadow Mary and the inclusion of Gentiles
- The voice shift from active to passive gennao, encoding the virgin birth in the genealogical grammar itself
- The direct legal claim to David's throne through the kingly line

Without Luke's genealogy, we would lack:
- The biological line from David through Nathan that bypasses the Jeconiah curse
- The universal scope extending to Adam and to God, connecting Jesus to all humanity
- The parenthetical "as was supposed" that distinguishes public reckoning from biological fact
- The literary context of baptism ("Thou art my beloved Son") leading to genealogy leading to temptation ("If thou be the Son of God")
- The resolution of the Jeconiah paradox, which requires a non-Solomonic Davidic line

God preserved both accounts because both are necessary. Together they demonstrate that Jesus of Nazareth -- and no one else -- could simultaneously fulfill every Messianic lineage prophecy: legal heir to the throne through Solomon's line, biological descendant of David through Nathan's line, seed of Abraham, tribe of Judah, born of a virgin, from Bethlehem, and son of God.
