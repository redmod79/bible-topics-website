## About This Collection

This site hosts standalone Bible studies that don't belong to a broader series. Each study is a self-contained investigation of a biblical topic, produced by the same three-agent research pipeline and tool-driven methodology used across all our studies.

Unlike a series organized around a single theme, these studies cover whatever questions arise from Scripture -- genealogies, prophecy, biblical history, theological concepts, and more. Each study stands on its own.

## The Approach

Every study follows the same core principles:

- **Scripture interprets Scripture.** Clear passages determine the reading of unclear ones.
- **Scope comes from tools, not training knowledge.** The AI does not decide which verses are relevant based on what it was trained on. Instead, tools search topical dictionaries, concordances, and semantic indexes to discover what Scripture says about the topic.
- **Research and analysis are separated.** The agent that gathers data is not the same agent that draws conclusions.
- **Every claim is traceable.** Raw tool output is preserved in each study's `raw-data/` folder.
